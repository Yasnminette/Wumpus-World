# Wumpus-World

In this project we needed to create an intelligent agent for the Wumpus game. The agent was supposed to start in the room [1, 1] and then move to the adjacent rooms in order to look for the gold and win the game. The agent was supposed to sense stench, breeze, glitter or nothing. If he sensed glitter it means that he is close to gold, if he sensed breeze it means that the pit is not too far and if he sensed stench, it means that the Wumpus in one of the neighbor rooms. This project was coded in prolog, where we created rules in the knowledge base in order to help the agent get the optimal path and not lose the game, by being eaten by the Wumpus or die because of a pit

This project was done bu Ahmed Al Hilal and Yasmine Najd
